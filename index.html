            <p>I'm Charlie, I'm fascinated by making our world a better place. I love moonshot ideas and understanding the complex systems at the heart of our societies. I've worked in data-driven policy and evidence-based governance at the World Bank, looking at poverty and social protection. I can code in R and Python, and am familiar with a range of packages. I love building things. </p>
